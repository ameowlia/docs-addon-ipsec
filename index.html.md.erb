<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This guide describes <%= vars.product_full %>, which secures data transmissions
inside [<%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>)](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/elastic-runtime/).
Topics covered in this guide include <%= vars.product_full %> installation and configuration,
troubleshooting, and certificate rotation.

Your org might require <%= vars.product_short %> if you transmit sensitive data.

<%= vars.product_full %> provides security to the network layer of the OSI model with a
[strongSwan](https://www.strongswan.org/) implementation of <%= vars.product_short %>.
It provides a strongSwan job in FIPS mode to each BOSH-deployed VM.

<%= vars.product_full %> encrypts IP data flow between hosts, between security gateways, between service tiles, and between security gateways and hosts.
It secures network traffic within a Cloud Foundry deployment
and provides internal system protection if a malicious actor breaches your firewall.

## <a id='limitations'></a> Limitations

<%= vars.product_full %> has the following limitations:

* <%= vars.product_full %> is not compatible with VMware NSX-T Container Plug-in for <%= vars.app_runtime_full %>.

* VMware recommends configuring <%= vars.product_full %> to use a self-signed certificate to sign instance certificates.
  VMware does not recommend using a certificate signed by a public or third-party CA.

* <%= vars.product_full %> is not supported on Windows.

* Container-to-container traffic is not encrypted unless the underlying network is also encrypted.
  Both the overlay network for container-to-container networking and the underlying, physical network
  for Diego Cell to Diego Cell networking must be included in the `ipsec_subnets` section of the IPsec manifest.
