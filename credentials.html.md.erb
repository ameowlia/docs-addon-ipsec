title: Rotating Active Certificates for IPsec for VMware Tanzu
owner: Security Engineering

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes the process VMware recommends to increase deployment security by rotating certificates in the <%= vars.product_full %> manifest.

## <a id='why'></a>Why you need to rotate credentials

These are common reasons for rotating credentials:

+ Your organizational security policy might specify how often you can apply these changes.

+ Your certificates are going to expire. To find the expiration dates on your certificates, see [Checking Certificate Dates](check-dates.html).

## <a id='procedures'></a> About the procedures

There are two procedures for certificate rotation described in this topic:

* [Procedure 1](#rotate-cert) describes rotating the following certificates specified in your <%= vars.product_short %> manifest:
  * The instance certificate and instance private key <br>
  This procedure requires updating BOSH. It does not include rotating the certificate authority (CA) certificate.

* [Procedure 2](#rotate-CA) describes rotating your CA certificate in addition to your instance certificate and instance private key. This procedure requires updating BOSH three times.

<p> The rolling deploys during these procedures result in minimal deployment downtime.</p>

## <a id="rotate-cert"></a>Procedure 1: Rotate the Instance Certificate and Instance Private Key

Follow these steps to rotate the instance certificate and instance private key.

1. Generate and sign a new instance certificate using your existing <%= vars.product_short %> CA certificate.

1. Update the instance certificate and the private key fields in your `ipsec-addon.yml` file with new values from the previous step.

1. Update the runtime config by running the following command:

    ```
    bosh -e BOSH-ENVIRONMENT update-runtime-config --name=ipsec PATH-TO-SAVE-THE-RUNTIME-CONFIG
    ```

    This step results in a few minutes of app downtime.

2. Go to your <%= vars.ops_manager %> interface in a browser.

3. If you are using <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.3 or later, click **Review Pending Changes**.
   For more information about this <%= vars.ops_manager %> page,
   see [Reviewing your pending product changes in Tanzu Operations Manager](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/3.0/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/install-review-pending-changes.html).

4. Click **Apply Changes**.

## <a id="rotate-CA"></a>Procedure 2: Rotate the CA Certificate, the Instance Certificate, and Instance Private Key

Follow these steps to rotate the CA certificate, instance certificate, and instance private key.

1. Generate a new CA certificate.

2. Append the newly generated CA certificate under the existing certificate as a new yaml list element in your `ipsec-addon.yml`.
  For example:

  ```
  <strong>ca_certificates</strong>:
      \- |
         -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
         ... <strong>\<ORIGINAL ROOT\></strong>
         -----END CERTIFICATE-----
      \- |
         -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
         ... <strong>\<NEW ROOT\></strong>
         -----END CERTIFICATE-----
         .
         .
         .
  ```

      For  <strong>v1.8.12</strong> and above: <%= vars.product_short %> supports CA certificate chain. <br /><br>
      Concatenate the contents of the root and the intermediate certificates as one of the list items in <strong>ca\_certificates</strong> (the root CA is at the top).

    ```
    <strong>ca\_certificates</strong>:
      \- |
         -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
         ... <strong>\<ORIGINAL ROOT\></strong>
         -----END CERTIFICATE-----
      \- |
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        ... <strong>\<NEW ROOT\></strong>
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        ... <strong>\<INTERMEDIATE 1 ISSUED BY THE NEW ROOT CERT ABOVE\></strong>
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        ... <strong>\<INTERMEDIATE 2 ISSUED BY THE INTERMEDIATE 1 ABOVE
        ... AND SIGNS THE NEW INSTANCE CERT\></strong>
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    ```

    <p class="note important">
    <span class="note__title">Important</span> The root and the intermediate certificates cannot have the same subjectName,
       also called the common name and set with <code>CN=</code>.<br>
       Also, the root certificate <b>must</b> be the first certificate of the chain.</p>

1. Update the runtime config by running the following command:

    ```
    bosh -e BOSH-ENVIRONMENT update-runtime-config --name=ipsec PATH-TO-SAVE-THE-RUNTIME-CONFIG
    ```

    This step results in a few minutes of app downtime.

2. Go to your <%= vars.ops_manager %> interface in a browser.

3. If you are using <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.3 or later, click **Review Pending Changes**.
   For more information about this <%= vars.ops_manager %> page,
   see [Reviewing your pending product changes in Tanzu Operations Manager](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/3.0/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/install-review-pending-changes.html).

4. Click **Apply Changes**.

5. Generate and sign a new instance certificate using your existing <%= vars.product_short %> CA certificate.

6. Update the instance certificate and the private key fields in the `ipsec-addon.yml` file with new values from above. </p>

7. Repeat step 3 to update the runtime config.

8. Go to your <%= vars.ops_manager %> interface in a browser.

9. If you are using <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.3 or later, click **Review Pending Changes**.

10. Click **Apply Changes**.

11. Delete the older CA certificate in the `ipsec-addon.yml` file.

12. Repeat step 3 to update the runtime config.

13. Go to your <%= vars.ops_manager %> interface in a browser.

14. If you are using <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.3 or later, click **Review Pending Changes**.

15. Click **Apply Changes**.
